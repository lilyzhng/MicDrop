           Guidelines:
           1. Verbatim Accuracy: Do not "clean up" grammar. Keep all "ums," "uhs," "likes," and repeated words. These are crucial for the coach to analyze later.
           2. Speaker Identification: Label speakers clearly (e.g., [Candidate], [Recruiter]) based on context.
           3. Timestamps: Insert a timestamp [00:00] every 30-60 seconds or at every speaker change.
           4. Non-Verbal Cues: Transcribe significant sounds in brackets, e.g., [nervous laughter], [long pause], [sigh], [typing noise].
           5. Output Format: Clean Markdown.
           6. Start Logic: Ignore any initial background noise, rustling, static, or setup sounds (e.g. microphone adjustments) at the very beginning of the file. Start the transcription strictly at the first intelligible human speech.`

            Goal: Analyze the user's interview transcript/audio input and provide "brutally honest" feedback to specific issues.
            
            KEY REQUIREMENT: HUMAN STORY REWRITING
            For every issue identified in the "Areas for Improvement" section, you MUST provide a "Human Rewrite" instead of a generic strategy.
            
            The Rewrite Philosophy:
            - The goal is NOT a polished press release. It is to sound like a colleague grabbing coffee.
            - Use "Bridge Words": "To be honest...", "Here's the thing...", "I say this with love...".
            - Use Vulnerability/Humor: Make it relatable.
            - Use Check-ins: "Does that match what you're seeing?"

            KEY REQUIREMENT: DELIVERY DYNAMICS (Pronunciation & Clarity)
            You must identify 3 specific moments where the user sounded 'Machine Gun' (Rushed/Monotone) vs 'Maestro' (Varied Pace/Emphasis).
            - Focus on Technical Terms: Candidates often rush "Convolutional Neural Networks". They should say "Con-vo-LU-tion-al... Neu-ral... NET-works".
            - Focus on Tone: Detect robotic delivery.
            - Create a "Drill": Use visual cues like UPPERCASE for stress and '...' for pauses.
            - NOTE: If no audio file is provided, skip this section or provide general advice based on the text structure (e.g. run-on sentences).
            
            Output Format:
            Provide feedback in this exact structure:
            1.  **The Diagnosis:** A 1-2 sentence summary of the biggest red flag.
            2.  **The Fix:** Tactical advice (Structure, Soft Skills).
            3.  **The "Human" Rewrite (Global):** A rewrite of the most critical part of their answer to sound conversational and high-EQ.
            4.  **Detailed Improvements:** For each specific issue found, provide:
                - Question: The specific question or discussion point from the interviewer that prompted this response (extract from transcript, or infer based on the answer).
                - The Issue: What went wrong.
                - Specific Instance: Quote the transcript.
                - The Human Rewrite: Rewrite THAT SPECIFIC part to be better.
                - Why This Works: Explain the EQ/Soft skills used (e.g. "bridge words signal authenticity").

            KEY REQUIREMENT: FLIP THE TABLE (Question Analysis)
            Analyze the questions the candidate asked during the interview. This is crucial for showing interest and strategic thinking.
            
            For each question the candidate asked:
            1. Extract the exact question
            2. Identify the conversation context when it was asked
            3. Analyze what was good or needs improvement
            4. If improvement needed, provide a better version that references the conversation context
            5. Explain why the improved version is stronger
            
            Also identify "Missed Opportunities":
            - Great questions the candidate SHOULD have asked but didn't
            - Base these on the actual conversation context
            - Explain why these questions would have demonstrated interest/strategic thinking
            
            Philosophy:
            - Great questions reference specific points from the conversation ("You mentioned X earlier...")
            - Great questions show curiosity about the role/team/company
            - Great questions demonstrate the candidate did research and is connecting dots
            - Avoid generic questions that could be asked anywhere
            
            Output Style:
            - Rating: 0-100 integer scale.
            - **Separation**: Split into 'detailedFeedback' (Improvements) and 'highlights' (Strengths).
            - detailedFeedback: MUST use the 'rewrite' and 'explanation' fields instead of generic improvement strategies.
            - highlights: Areas where the candidate excelled.
            - flipTheTable: Analysis of questions asked by the candidate and missed opportunities.

IMPORTANT: This recording contains TWO speakers:
1. An AI Mock Interviewer asking the question (IGNORE this part)
2. The Candidate answering (ANALYZE ONLY this part)

The candidate's script/answer they were practicing:
"${scriptText}"

Your Task:
Evaluate the CANDIDATE'S delivery (not the interviewer) across these dimensions:
1. **Pace & Rhythm**: Are they rushing? Speaking too slowly? Monotone? Do they vary their pace for emphasis?
2. **Clarity & Articulation**: Are words clear and crisp, or mumbled? Any pronunciation issues?
3. **Engagement vs Monologuing**: Does it sound conversational and engaging, or like they're reading a script/monologuing?
4. **Vocal Variety**: Do they use pauses, emphasis, and tonal changes? Or is it flat?
5. **Confidence & Presence**: Do they sound confident and authentic, or nervous/robotic?

Keep feedback BRIEF but ACTIONABLE. Focus on the top 2-3 issues in the candidate's answer only.

Provide:
- rating (0-100): Overall delivery score for the CANDIDATE
- summary (2-3 sentences): Quick assessment of the candidate's delivery strengths and biggest weakness
- suggestions (3 brief tips): Actionable advice to improve the candidate's delivery
- pronunciationFeedback (2-4 specific drills): Target the WORST delivery moments in the candidate's answer - rushed phrases, monotone sections, unclear words. Use visual drills with CAPS for emphasis and ... for pauses.` }
