-- ========================================
-- CATEGORY: Arrays (10 problems)
-- ========================================

-- 1. Two Sum
UPDATE public.blind_problems SET detailed_hint = 
'Think about this problem in terms of what you''re really searching for at each step. As you iterate through the array, for each number you see, you''re asking: "Does the number I need to complete this sum exist somewhere I''ve already seen?"

This is a classic complement search problem. Instead of using nested loops to check every pair (O(n²)), you can use a hash map to remember what you''ve seen. For each number, calculate target - current_number to find what you need. If it''s in your map, you''re done. If not, add the current number to the map for future lookups.

The key insight: you''re trading space for time by storing past values for O(1) lookup.'
WHERE title = 'Two Sum';

-- 2. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
UPDATE public.blind_problems SET detailed_hint = 
'The key insight is that for any given day, the maximum profit you can make by selling on that day depends only on the minimum price you''ve seen BEFORE that day. You can''t go back in time to buy.

Visualize it: as you scan left to right through prices, you''re maintaining the best "buy" opportunity so far. At each new price, you calculate the potential profit if you sold today (current_price - min_price_so_far), and update your max profit if it''s better.

This is a single-pass solution because both values you''re tracking (min_price and max_profit) only look backwards.'
WHERE title = 'Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock';

-- 3. Contains Duplicate
UPDATE public.blind_problems SET detailed_hint = 
'This is a fundamental problem about detecting if you''ve seen something before. As you iterate through the array, you need constant-time lookup to check "have I seen this number already?"

A hash set is perfect for this because it gives you O(1) insertion and O(1) lookup. The moment you try to add a number that already exists in the set, you''ve found your duplicate.

Alternative approach: Sort the array first, then check adjacent elements. But this is O(n log n) vs O(n) with the hash set approach.'
WHERE title = 'Contains Duplicate';

-- 4. Product of Array Except Self
UPDATE public.blind_problems SET detailed_hint = 
'The trick is to realize that for any position i, the answer is (product of all elements to the left of i) × (product of all elements to the right of i).

You can compute this with two passes:
1. First pass (left to right): Build up a "prefix product" array where each position contains the product of all elements before it.
2. Second pass (right to left): Multiply each position by the "suffix product" (product of all elements after it).

The clever optimization: You don''t need separate arrays. Use the result array for prefix products, then multiply in-place during the second pass with a running suffix product.'
WHERE title = 'Product of Array Except Self';

-- 5. Maximum Subarray
UPDATE public.blind_problems SET detailed_hint = 
'Kadane''s Algorithm is elegant once you understand the core decision at each step: "Should I extend the current subarray, or start fresh?"

At each position, you ask: "Is the previous subarray helping me or hurting me?" If the running sum is negative, it''s hurting—any future elements would be larger on their own. So you reset and start a new subarray at the current element.

Track two things: the current sum (which might reset) and the maximum sum seen so far. The current sum represents "the best subarray ending here."'
WHERE title = 'Maximum Subarray';

-- 6. Maximum Product Subarray
UPDATE public.blind_problems SET detailed_hint = 
'Unlike max sum, products have a twist: multiplying two negatives makes a positive. So a very negative number could become very positive later!

You need to track BOTH the maximum AND minimum products ending at each position. When you see a negative number, what was your minimum becomes your maximum (after multiplication) and vice versa.

At each step, compute both: max_ending_here = max(num, num*prev_max, num*prev_min) and min_ending_here = min(num, num*prev_max, num*prev_min). Update your global result accordingly.

Don''t forget: zeros reset everything because anything times zero is zero.'
WHERE title = 'Maximum Product Subarray';

-- 7. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
UPDATE public.blind_problems SET detailed_hint = 
'The rotation creates a "pivot point" where the array is split into two sorted halves. The minimum is at this pivot. Your goal: use binary search to find where the "break" is.

Compare the middle element to the rightmost element:
- If mid > right: The minimum must be in the right half (the break happened there)
- If mid < right: The minimum is in the left half (including mid itself—it might be the minimum!)

Key detail: Use right = mid (not mid - 1) when going left, because mid could be the answer. But use left = mid + 1 when going right, because mid definitely isn''t the minimum in that case.'
WHERE title = 'Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array';

-- 8. Search in Rotated Sorted Array
UPDATE public.blind_problems SET detailed_hint = 
'The key insight: even though the array is rotated, at least ONE half is always properly sorted. You can use this to determine which half to search.

Find the midpoint and figure out which half is sorted:
- If nums[left] <= nums[mid]: Left half is sorted
- Otherwise: Right half is sorted

Once you know which half is sorted, check if the target lies within that sorted range. If yes, search there. If no, search the other half.

This gives you O(log n) because you''re still halving the search space each time.'
WHERE title = 'Search in Rotated Sorted Array';

-- 9. 3Sum
UPDATE public.blind_problems SET detailed_hint = 
'The key to making this O(n²) instead of O(n³) is to first sort the array, then use the two-pointer technique.

For each number at index i, you''re looking for two numbers to its right that sum to -nums[i]. This becomes a two-sum problem! Use two pointers (left starting at i+1, right starting at end).

If the sum is too small, move left pointer right. Too big, move right pointer left. When you find a match, move BOTH pointers (and skip duplicates!).

The sorting helps with: (1) the two-pointer approach, and (2) skipping duplicate triplets efficiently.'
WHERE title = '3Sum';

-- 10. Container With Most Water
UPDATE public.blind_problems SET detailed_hint = 
'Start with the widest possible container (pointers at both ends). The area = min(height[left], height[right]) × (right - left).

Now the key insight: To possibly find a larger area, you must move the pointer at the SHORTER line inward. Why? The height is limited by the shorter line, and moving the taller line inward would only decrease width while never increasing the height limit.

By always moving the shorter pointer, you guarantee you''re exploring all configurations that could potentially be larger. You never need to move the taller pointer because any container formed by doing so would be smaller.'
WHERE title = 'Container With Most Water';

-- CATEGORY: Binary (5 problems)
-- ========================================

-- 11. Sum of Two Integers
UPDATE public.blind_problems SET detailed_hint = 
'You need to add without + or -. Think about what happens in binary addition:
- XOR (^) gives you the sum without carrying (1+1=0, 1+0=1, 0+0=0)
- AND (&) gives you the positions where carries occur (1+1 produces a carry)
- Left shift (<<1) moves those carries to the correct position

The algorithm: XOR for the partial sum, AND + left shift for the carry. Repeat until there''s no carry left.

Watch for negative numbers in languages that don''t handle integer overflow the same way. You may need to mask to 32 bits.'
WHERE title = 'Sum of Two Integers';

-- 12. Number of 1 Bits
UPDATE public.blind_problems SET detailed_hint = 
'The straightforward way: check each of the 32 bits using right shift and AND with 1. But there''s a clever trick.

The expression n & (n-1) clears the rightmost set bit. Why? When you subtract 1, you flip all bits from the rightmost 1 to the end. ANDing with the original clears just that bit.

Example: 1100 & 1011 = 1000 (cleared the rightmost 1)

Count how many times you can do this before n becomes 0. That''s your answer, and it only iterates once per set bit!'
WHERE title = 'Number of 1 Bits';

-- 13. Counting Bits
UPDATE public.blind_problems SET detailed_hint = 
'You could solve each number independently, but there''s a beautiful pattern using dynamic programming.

Key observation: The number of 1s in i equals the number of 1s in i/2 (right shift) plus whether i''s last bit is 1.
Formula: dp[i] = dp[i >> 1] + (i & 1)

Alternatively: dp[i] = dp[i & (i-1)] + 1, using the "clear last bit" trick.

Both approaches give O(n) time because you''re building on previously computed results.'
WHERE title = 'Counting Bits';

-- 14. Missing Number
UPDATE public.blind_problems SET detailed_hint = 
'Three elegant approaches, all O(n) time:

1. Math: The sum of 0 to n is n*(n+1)/2. Calculate expected sum, subtract actual sum of array.

2. XOR: XOR all array indices (0 to n-1) and the number n, then XOR all array values. Since a^a=0, everything pairs off except the missing number.

3. Cyclic sort (in-place): Since values are in range [0,n], place each value at its "correct" index. The index without its matching value is the answer.

The XOR solution is particularly elegant because it uses no extra space and handles overflow gracefully.'
WHERE title = 'Missing Number';

-- 15. Reverse Bits
UPDATE public.blind_problems SET detailed_hint = 
'Process each bit from right to left, build the result from left to right.

For each of the 32 iterations:
1. Extract the last bit of n using (n & 1)
2. Add it to result (shift result left first, then OR with the extracted bit)
3. Right shift n to process the next bit

After 32 iterations, your result is the reversed number.

Optimization: Use a lookup table for 8-bit chunks if you need to reverse many numbers.'

-- 16. Climbing Stairs
UPDATE public.blind_problems SET detailed_hint = 
'This is the Fibonacci sequence in disguise! To reach step n, you could have come from step n-1 (one step) or step n-2 (two steps).

So: ways(n) = ways(n-1) + ways(n-2)

Base cases: ways(1) = 1 (one way to climb 1 stair), ways(2) = 2 (either 1+1 or 2).

You only need the last two values, so you can solve this in O(1) space instead of maintaining a full DP array.'
WHERE title = 'Climbing Stairs';

-- 17. Coin Change
UPDATE public.blind_problems SET detailed_hint = 
'Build up from smaller amounts. Define dp[i] = minimum coins needed to make amount i.

For each amount from 1 to target, try each coin. If you can use a coin (coin <= amount), then: dp[amount] = min(dp[amount], dp[amount - coin] + 1)

The intuition: "If I use this coin, I need 1 + (minimum coins to make the remaining amount)."

Initialize dp[0] = 0 (zero coins for zero amount). Initialize all others to infinity or amount+1 (impossible). If dp[target] is still impossible at the end, return -1.'
WHERE title = 'Coin Change';

-- 18. Longest Increasing Subsequence
UPDATE public.blind_problems SET detailed_hint = 
'Classic DP approach (O(n²)): Let dp[i] = length of longest increasing subsequence ending at index i. For each i, look back at all j < i where nums[j] < nums[i], and take dp[i] = max(dp[j] + 1).

Optimized approach (O(n log n)): Maintain a "tails" array where tails[i] is the smallest ending element for an increasing subsequence of length i+1. For each number, binary search to find where it fits (replace or extend). The final length is len(tails).

The tails array trick works because you''re greedily keeping the best (smallest) ending element for each length.'
WHERE title = 'Longest Increasing Subsequence';

-- 19. Longest Common Subsequence
UPDATE public.blind_problems SET detailed_hint = 
'Use a 2D DP table where dp[i][j] = LCS length for text1[0..i-1] and text2[0..j-1].

The recurrence:
- If text1[i-1] == text2[j-1]: dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1 (extend the LCS)
- Otherwise: dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) (take the best of skipping either character)

Build the table bottom-up, and the answer is dp[m][n].

Space optimization: Since you only need the previous row, you can reduce to O(min(m,n)) space.'
WHERE title = 'Longest Common Subsequence';

-- 20. Word Break
UPDATE public.blind_problems SET detailed_hint = 
'Define dp[i] = true if s[0..i-1] can be segmented into dictionary words.

For each position i, check all possible last words: for j from 0 to i-1, if dp[j] is true AND s[j..i-1] is in the dictionary, then dp[i] = true.

The intuition: "Can I find a valid split point where everything before it is breakable, and the rest is a dictionary word?"

Base case: dp[0] = true (empty string is valid). Answer: dp[n].

Optimization: Convert dictionary to a set for O(1) word lookup.'

-- 21. Combination Sum
UPDATE public.blind_problems SET detailed_hint = 
'This is a backtracking problem. At each step, you have choices: include a candidate or skip it. Since you can reuse candidates, when you include one, don''t move to the next index—stay and consider including it again.

Build combinations recursively. When the remaining target becomes 0, you''ve found a valid combination. When it goes negative or you''ve exhausted candidates, backtrack.

To avoid duplicates like [2,3] and [3,2], always iterate forward from your current index. This ensures you build combinations in sorted order.'

"The best at house i is either: (1) I robbed house i-2, skipped i-1, and rob i, OR (2) I take whatever was best up to i-1."

You only need two variables (prev1, prev2) instead of a full array, giving O(1) space.'
WHERE title = 'House Robber';

-- 23. House Robber II
UPDATE public.blind_problems SET detailed_hint = 
'The houses form a circle, so house 0 and house n-1 are adjacent. You can''t rob both.

The trick: Run the House Robber I solution twice:
1. Once on houses [0..n-2] (exclude the last house)
2. Once on houses [1..n-1] (exclude the first house)

Return the maximum of these two results. This covers all valid scenarios because at least one of the first or last house must be excluded.'
WHERE title = 'House Robber II';

-- 24. Decode Ways
UPDATE public.blind_problems SET detailed_hint = 
'At each position, ask: "How many ways can I decode up to here?"

dp[i] represents the number of ways to decode s[0..i-1].

Single digit: If s[i-1] is ''1''-''9'' (valid), add dp[i-1] ways.
Two digits: If s[i-2:i] forms a valid number (10-26), add dp[i-2] ways.

Edge cases are tricky: ''0'' cannot stand alone, so ''0'' means 0 ways unless it''s part of ''10'' or ''20''. Leading zeros in two-digit numbers (like ''01'') are invalid.

Base: dp[0] = 1 (empty prefix has one way). Answer: dp[n].'

UPDATE public.blind_problems SET detailed_hint = 
'In a grid, to reach cell (i,j), you must have come from either (i-1,j) or (i,j-1). So: dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1].

Initialize the first row and first column to 1 (only one way to reach any cell on the edge—keep going in one direction).

Space optimization: You only need the previous row, so use a 1D array of size n. Update in-place left to right: dp[j] = dp[j] + dp[j-1].

Math approach: This is a combinatorics problem. You need (m-1) downs and (n-1) rights in any order. Answer: C(m+n-2, m-1).'

UPDATE public.blind_problems SET detailed_hint =

If at any point your current index exceeds maxReach, you''re stuck—return false. If maxReach >= last index, return true.

Alternative DP approach: Work backwards. A position is "good" if you can reach the end from it. Check if any jump from the current position lands on a "good" position.

The greedy approach is O(n) time and O(1) space.'

2. Connect cloned neighbors correctly

DFS approach: For each node, create its clone if not exists. Then recursively clone all neighbors and connect them.

BFS approach: Use a queue. Clone the starting node, then for each node in the queue, clone its neighbors (if not already cloned) and add them to the queue.

The map ensures each node is cloned exactly once.'

BFS/Kahn''s algorithm: Track in-degrees. Start with nodes that have 0 in-degree (no prerequisites). Remove each from the graph, decreasing neighbors'' in-degrees. If you process all nodes, no cycle. If nodes remain with non-zero in-degree, there''s a cycle.'

Why this is O(n): Each number is only counted once—either as a sequence start (and we extend from there) or as part of another sequence (skipped because num-1 exists).
